A "deface template" typically refers to a pre-designed layout or set of code that is used to modify the appearance of a website or webpage illegally, often with the intent of defacing or vandalizing it. Website defacement involves unauthorized access to a website's content management system or server and then making alterations to the visible content, such as changing text, images, or other elements. This activity is considered illegal and unethical.
